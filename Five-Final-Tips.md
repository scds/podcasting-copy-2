# Five Final Tips

Over the course of this web module, you've learned to plan, record, edit, host, and promote a podcast. 

Before you begin creating your show, five final tips:

1. Editing will take the longest amount of time. 
2. But! Good planning and a good audio recording make for much easier audio editing
3. Podcasts are attainable. A microphone + editing software + internet for distribution = all you need 
4. Think of your relationship with your listener as a contract or a friendship and treat it as such. 
5. And finally, if you want help, we’re here.
