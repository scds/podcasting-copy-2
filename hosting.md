## Don't be Intimidated! Hosting is Simple

Other than editing, this is the section that intimidates people most. But getting your show onto major platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify is easier than you think. 

Your first step is creating an RSS Feed. RSS stands for “Really Simple Syndication” because it really is simple! An RSS feed will pick up new episodes of your podcast and automatically update major directories (the platforms where you download episodes and listen to shows). It's crucial to getting your show out. 

While you can [code your own RSS feed](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-RSS-Feed), beginners will probably find it much easier to use a service. Many  hosting services have free tiers, including [Acast](https://www.acast.com/), [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/), [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/), [PodBean](https://www.podbean.com/), [RSS.com](https://rss.com/), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). 

## Setting Up Your Show

Once you choose a service, the platform will offer an intuitive workflow to set up your podcast. The steps will include:
1. Uploading a sample episode of the show.
2. Completing fields including title, show describtion, category tags, and more to clarify your show's identity beyond a single audio file.
3. Giving the hosting service permission to submit that episode to major directories including Apple Podcasts, Breaker, Castbox, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Radio Public, Spotify, and more. 
4. Waiting up to two weeks for directories to approve your show. 
- Note: ApplePodcasts takes longer than other distributors. This is normal. Because it's one of the most popular directories, it's crucial to get your show on their platform. If you're in a rush, manually submitting your show to them may speed up the process. Otherwise, leave submissions to the hosting service. 

Once your show has been approved, you can roll out your podcast by uploading more episodes and scheduling them for release on your hosting service. Be sure to write unique descriptions for each episode. Some services also allow you to upload unique artwork for each episode. 

Your hosting service will likely track downloads, listening time, and audience demographics, depending on what they offer on various tiers.
