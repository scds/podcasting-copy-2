# Accessibility

Make your show an inclusive space. Create a transcript of your episodes so that everyone can access your content. 

You can do this manually, which will take a long time but be virtually free from error, or use software that will automatically transcribe the audio, then manually correct the transcript. Any auto-generated transcript will have errors, so this correction phase is necessary. 

Auto-Transcript Options include built-in tools in programs such as [Microsoft Word](https://shorturl.at/clqwC), [Echo360](https://echo360.ca/), [GoogleDocs](https://www.theverge.com/21368867/transcription-google-docs-live-transcribe-how-to-zoom) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
Custom transcript generation software options include [Otter AI](https://otter.ai/) and [Rev](https://www.rev.com/). 
One high-quality on-campus option for McMaster students is located in Lyons New Media Lab, where you can access Adobe Premiere Pro (video editing software). This software can auto transcribe audio files, and its accuracy and speed are impressive. 

Additionally, use a [colour contrast checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) while creating your branding so that everyone can read and understand your logo.
