## Before Editing Checklist

Before you begin to edit your podcast, there are a few things you should consider:
- Transfer your audio files to your computer and place them in a folder.
- Sort through your audio files, renaming the files accordingly.
- Create backup copies of your unedited audio files in a separate folder.
- Use headphones instead of solely relying on your computer’s speakers.
- Keep your script nearby – This will act as a guide as you edit.
- And of course, downloading and installing an audio editing program. But which one?

## Copyright Concerns

Many podcasts use music at some point in the episode. If you do not have the budget to hire a composer, browse repositories like [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/search/theme/music%20for%20videos/) and the YouTube Audio Library for audio that you can legally use in your show. Note that the YouTube Audio Library cannot be linked because it is accessed through the "Creator Studio"--which simply means that you need a (free) YouTube account to access the files.
